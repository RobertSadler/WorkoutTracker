### Project Step 2
### Expanding on Website Idea

---

Many people that either go to the gym or workout on their own tend to follow a certain routine that helps them achieve their goal. Although they could track their progress manually, this website would assist them in having an easy to use tracker that will display information related to how they did their workout.
This website will allow the user to keep track of different exercises that they do during their workouts. This will help those that wish to stay on a specific schedule or be able to view their progress. 



Main menu options with log-in/out options are needed if a password system is implemented. These main menu options would be:

**Home**: Returns the user to their workout summary/profile page

**Help**: A short page that explains key aspects of this website

**Logout**: Allows the user to switch profiles, which would be useful on a computer with multiple users



There will be three main features from which the user can choose:

**Add workout**: Allows the user to create values for different workouts that will be used in a chart within their profile page.

**Edit workout**: Allows the user to modify values of a workout that they previously submitted.

**Delete workout**: Allows the user to remove a workout from the list which will remove those values from the workout summary in the profile page.



Workout exercises will be divided into values that the user will be able to create and modify, since not all users will be doing the same workouts. Another value that will be focused on will be “Calories Burned” as it would give a visible proof of the user’s workout and allow them to make goals to reach the desired calories that they want to burn. This could be further categorized into types of exercises, such as endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance.
Features of the “workout section” will be:

An ability to add a variable and be able to name it, which will let the user add any exercise that they want.

An ability to add a value for time to each exercise variable.

An ability to add a repetition value if applicable to each variable.

An ability to add a variable that represents calories burned that will be calculated by using the values for time and repetition.



This website is intended to be used in order to track and help schedule workout schedules and to help show progress. Users will be able to input different values of their workouts into the database and be able to track their progress within their profile.
